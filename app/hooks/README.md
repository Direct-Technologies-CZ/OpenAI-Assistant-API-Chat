# README for `useChatState` Hook in `/hooks` Folder

## Overview
The `useChatState` hook, located in the `/hooks` folder, is a custom React hook designed to manage the state of the chat application. This hook centralizes the state management for various aspects of the chat interface, making it easier to maintain and update the chat's behavior and data.

## Functionality

### State Management
`useChatState` employs React's `useState` and `useRef` hooks to manage a range of state variables:

- `assistantName`, `setAssistantName`: Manages the name of the AI assistant.
- `assistantModel`, `setAssistantModel`: Keeps track of the AI model in use (defaulting to 'gpt-3.5-turbo-1106').
- `assistantDescription`, `setAssistantDescription`: Stores a description for the assistant.
- `inputmessage`, `setInputmessage`: Manages the input message state.
- `chatMessages`, `setChatMessages`: An array to store chat messages, each with a role and content.
- `chatStarted`, `setChatStarted`: A boolean indicating if the chat has started.
- `isButtonDisabled`, `setIsButtonDisabled`: Controls the disabled state of UI buttons.
- `file`, `setFile`: Manages the state of a file uploaded by the user.
- `assistantId`, `setAssistantId`: Stores the unique ID of the assistant.
- `threadId`, `setThreadId`: Keeps the ID of the current chat thread.
- `isStartLoading`, `setStartLoading`: Indicates if the chat is in the loading state.
- `isSending`, `setIsSending`: Signifies if a message is currently being sent.
- `statusMessage`, `setStatusMessage`: Manages status messages displayed to the user.
- `counter`: A `useRef` hook to keep track of a counter, useful for operations that need persistence but not re-rendering.

### Usage
This hook is used to streamline the state management across the chat application, particularly in components that handle user interactions, message displays, and the overall chat flow.

## Best Practices
- Keep the state variables focused and relevant to the chat application's requirements.
- Ensure synchronization between the states managed by this hook and other parts of the application.

## Contribution Guidelines
- When adding new state variables, ensure they are integral to the chat's functionality.
- Maintain the naming convention for consistency and readability.
- Test thoroughly to ensure new states integrate smoothly with existing ones.

## Conclusion
The `useChatState` hook is a foundational part of the chat application, providing a centralized and efficient way to manage the application's state. Its proper use is crucial for maintaining the application's reactivity and user experience.
